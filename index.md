    <p>I am currently an assistant lecturer at the College of Information Science and Technology, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, China. My research interest lies in Spoken/Natural Language Understanding (SLU/NLU), Knowledge-guide NLP, and other areas.  In the long run, I am keen to designing deep learning algorithms for improving interpretability and understanding for SLU/NLU, with a primary focus on spoken text and natural language data. Specifically, I mainly focus on: (1) developing knowledge-based algorithms to introduce different knowledge to utterance domain classification task in SLU; (2) developing representation learning algorithms to improve context understanding for entity type classification; (3)  developing denoising algorithms to reduce label noise for entity type classification. Recently, I've been focusing on leveraging cue words for contextual understanding of the entity, e.g., syntax-related words.</p>
       <p>Before joining the Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, I received my bachelor’s degree and master’s degree from South China Agricultural University (SCAU), Guangzhou, China.</p></div>
